# MiData analysis app

This application is being developed to analyse midata files. The user will be able to upload a midata csv file containing details of financial transactions, and receive personalised recommendations relating to money-saving opportunities based on these data. 

The application is developed using the MEAN stack, with an R script performing the data analysis.

The repository contains two sub-directories:

	1. **dev** - containing the app in development.
	2. **misc_testing** - containing miscellaneous code to test specific features (e.g. Plotly).

Please respect this organisational structure when contributing to this repository.
